# Setup
You can create a base project by cloning this repository or by using
`react-native init` and copying over and rewriting the relevant content / files
that you need.

Cloning and working from the boilerplate is recommended at this time.

**_Beware of copy/pasted code! You should review and code you are copying as if
it were written from scatch._**

**Make sure that you remove the `.git` directory for app if you clone it and
start fresh with `git init`**.

See [the example apps documentation](doc/example-apps.md) for more information.

## Installation
Requirements:
* `yarn` 1.3.2
* `node` 9

---

Once you have your base project set up, run `yarn install`.

Now run `npx react-native-rename $PROJECT_NAME -b $BUNDLE_ID`. You will be
prompted for the app name, bundle identifier, and other information that needs
to be changed from the boilerplate.

You're now ready to start working on your new project!
