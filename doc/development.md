# Development
*Familiarize yourself with the `react-native` CLI. You can use the `--help`
option when running commands to see more options such as
`react-native run-ios --help` or `react-native run-android --help` (which have
pretty different options).*

The easiest way to develop locally is to start the local development server and
run the app in an iOS and/or Android simulator/emulator.

```
react-native start
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```

If you have a simulator open for a platform, React Native will use it
automatically with the `run-<platform>` command. Otherwise you can specify a
device or simulator with the options for `react-native run-<platform>`.

You can open an iOS simulator using Xcode and an Android simulator using Android
Studio or the `emulator` Android tools command.

Once the app is running in the simulator, you can reload it with
<kbd>Cmd-r</kbd> on iOS or <kbd>r r</kbd> on Android. You can also open the menu
with <kbd>Cmd-d</kbd> on iOS or <kbd>Cmd-m</kbd> in Android. This will give you
options to enable live reloading, hot reloading, and remote JS debugging.

Remember that the React Native bundle server (`react-native start`) must be running for
`run-<platform>` to work. You may want to use `react-native start --reset-cache`
in some cases, especially if your app crashes or new changes aren't being
reflected.

You can use the bundle server for more than one simulator/emulator/device at a
time which will allow you to develop the app on multiple platforms at once.

*I find it's easier to develop functionality for one platform and then test
against the other platform and make minor changes that may be needed for it
specifically.*

## Debugging
Install the third party React Native Debugger: https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger

```sh
brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger
```

This is a standalone app. In order to use it, open it via:

```sh
open "rndebugger://set-debugger-loc?host=localhost&port=8081"
```

Once the app is running in your simulator/emulator, type <kbd>Cmd-d</kbd> for
iOS or <kbd>Cmd-m</kbd> for Android and select "Debug JS Remotely" if it is not
already selected. Now you should see logging in the debugger.

You can also set the debugger at React Native server start time using the
`REACT_DEBUGGER` environment variable. For example:

```sh
REACT_DEBUGGER="open -g 'rndebugger://set-debugger-loc?port=8081' || ''" react-native start
```

This should open the debugger automatically in the background when you turn on
"Debug JS Remotely." You can remove the `-g` flag if you want it to pop to the
foreground when it opens.

The project setup should allow Redux devtools to work out of the box.

**Note:** You can only use the debugger with one emulator/simulator/device at
a time.

To debug network requests, you can right-click the debugger and select "Enable
Network Inspect." There are some limitations. See:
https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger/blob/master/docs/network-inspect-of-chrome-devtools.md

## Hot Reloading
Hot reloading re-renders the current view / screen with changes you've made to
that file or any dependent files in real time. This is different than live
reloading which will restart the app automatically when you make changes.
Using hot reloading is highly recommended at least in cases where you are
developing screens since it doens't clobber navigation or global state
(component state is still clobbered unless handled specifically).

Hot reloading should be supported with our base modules. Some hot reloading will
cause errors or not work properly. In this case, you can manually reload the
app with <kbd>Cmd-r</kbd> on iOS or <kbd>r r</kbd> on Android. If hot reloading
is causing too many issues while you're developing something, you can also turn
it off and turn live reloading on (or just handle reloading on your own).

If you are running multiple simulators or devices, hot/live reloading changes
will propagate to all of them at once.

If working from the base or example app, try enabling hot reloading and then
making a change to the source to see it in action.

In most cases hot reloading should just work :tm:. In some cases it won't work
properly or as you expect. You can dig into the API to improve hot reloading in
some areas of the code to help with development.

## Path Aliases
In order to make importing more convenient, absolute imports can be done from
the `src` directory. For example:

```ts
// App.tsx
import { API_URL } from 'src/Config.ts';
```

This will work instead of having to do `../src/Config.ts` or `./Config.ts` or
finding a relative path for a given module/file.

This works by having `tsconfig.json#compilerOptions.baseUrl: "."` and also
having `src/package.json#name: "src"`.

You can create more path aliases in a similar fashion by adding a
`package.json` to a given path with a name that corresponds to the path alias.

### For Tests
This is handled via `package.json@jest.moduleNameMapper: "src(.*)": "<rootDir>/src/$1"`.
This maps any imports from `src/` to the root of the project.

## Environment Variables / Configuration
**Do not set secret configuration in version control or the environment**.

Configuration of the app is handled through environment variables. When running
the development server, or bundling, the environment variables must be set.

```
API_HOST=test react-native start
```

In order to add a new environment variable, update `src/Config.ts`:

```ts
+ export const NAME = get(process.env['NAME'], 'default value');
```

Now you can `import { NAME } from 'src/Config` wherever it's needed.

Remember to set the environment variables you need before running `react-native
start`, `xcodebuild`, or `android/gradlew assemble$DEBUG_OR_RELEASE`.
